### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->

#### What went well?
The gathering of data from different data sources and use of different materials found both in-class and over the internet was a great experience. Though not as smooth as I hoped it would be, but it was great to be exposed to such knowledge and learning
#### What did not go well?
The Machine learning section was the one section that I would say did not go quite well. I encountered so many errors that I had to cleanup to get the code working, and I was struggling the most with the understanding of some concepts
#### What did you learn?
I learnt how it is important to be on top of your project, I learnt how Python can be used in performing data analysis, and learnt the basics of machine learning. And how predictive and transformative analysis can be performed using different Python Modules.
#### What would you do differently next time?
Probably ask more nquestions than I did, and take the course in-person rather than online.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
